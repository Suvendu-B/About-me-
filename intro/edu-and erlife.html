		<h2>Early Life</h2>
			<p>I was born in Paradip, Odisha in 30 August,2000. I completed my matric(10th Exam) in Paradip. After that me with my parents moved to Bhubaneswar for my higher education.<br>I was preparing for IIT-JEE but sadly i couldnt qualify and then I went to Sambalpur for my Engeneereing Degree.</p>
		<h2>Education</h2>
			<p>I completed my matric(10th Board) in Bethany Convent School affiliated to ICSE Board. I graduated with good marks.<br>
			Then I moved to Bhubaneswar. There I got an admission in ODM Public School affiliated to CBSE Board. Here also I graduated with very good marks.<br> 
			But this was not enough I had to get good marks in IIT-JEE exams but sadly I couldn't. <br>Dropping 1 year was not an option for me so I got an admission in a state funded public institute in Sambalpur namely Sambalpur University Institue of Information Technology(SUIIT).<br>
			I have been pursuing my B.Tech degree in Computer Science Engeneering(CSE) for 2 years now.</p>
